## Intro
Dungeons and dragons is a role playing game played by a master (who leads the game and creates the world) and a group of players who form a party of adventurers, ready to be involved in the fantasy world generated by the Dungeon Master.
We will be talking about this because there are many things in common between a D&D party and a team. At least from the academic point of view ...

## Speaking of which
I met my later-to-be wife through a common group of friends playing D&D (something like 35 years ago). I think this had a lot of influence in our relationship, we are still 2 nerds and we call each other "monster" as a sort of pet name.
I am mentioning this because she later went studying Psychology at University, and this turned up particularly helpful for me many years after ...

## Gruppo di lavoro lavoro di gruppo
A good 8 years ago I had the opportunity to become a manager. Being an engineer from most of my career, it was really a big change, and I felt really unprepared for the task.
Luckily enough my "monster", handed me over an old university sociology textbook that explains how a group of people "works". I found it incredibly helpful and I still refer to that after many years.

## Why a team
A team allows to enhance each others and to be bigger than the sum of the parts
Collaboration increases:
- productivity
- reliability
- innovation
- sense of belonging and happiness
This is true of course if the team functions properly

## What is a team
What is a party of adventurers ? what is the fundamental premise that allows them to actually play together ?

## The goal
A group of individuals is not a team. They can become a team. If they have a common GOAL.

## The goal
The goal should be:
- discussed within the team
- explicit rather than implicit
- compatible with organisation goal
- supported by the organisation
- measurable
- doable
If the goal doesn't tick all these boxes, then it can really generate issues!

## Classes
In D&D every player has a specific class: warriors, wizard, paladin, thief etc.
Adventures are often designed in such a way to make teamwork and collaboration across different characters and classes necessary to be successful.

## Team Roles
In any type of teams there are implicit or explicit "roles" covering specific areas:
- result
- methodology
- innovation
- communication
In an healthy team everyone has one or more roles


## Team dysfunctions connected to roles
In this model we are able to identify a few common dysfunctions:
- one of the roles is not covered
- team member without role
- leader-does-all

## Team characteristics
In D&D each player has a sheet with their character's stats: like intelligence, strength, dexterity, wisdom etc.

Team characteristics are like that, but measured on a team.
This is another useful model that can be used to identify team issues. Reflecting on these particular team characteristic:

Openness: how neat are the boundaries of the team?
Cohesion: do we share the same norms and values ?
Interdependence: how much we depend each other?
Fragmentation: can we recognise subgroups in the team?
Specialisation: are we able to cover all necessary functions?
Integration: do we accept each other ideas?

## Team characteristics dysfunctions
A functional team needs the right amount of each one of these characteristics. Not too low, and not too high.
Diversity plays also a big role in balancing the characteristics.

## Communication
Take into consideration culture, roles (authority), context and relationship
Team "dialect".

## Psychological safety
Team members are not feeling safe to express themselves for fear of negative repercussions or just because they are regularly ignored.
This makes ...

## Team conflicts
Managing conflicts (some guidelines):

never ignore
do not blame but find causes
negotiate and not barter
talk facts and not opinions
value different point of view
value common points
do not put proposal in conflict, but in relation

## Leadership
A D&D party can function at its best not just through individual initiative, but also through coordination of their actions.
In a group of people this is facilitated by a leader. This can emerge naturally but in an organisation is often preferred to institute one.

## Institutional leader
Responsible for team's output, goal and resources.

## Institutional Leadership issues
- Lack of competence
- Tyrant leader (micromanager)
- Different from team expectations

## Institutional leader in a complex organisation
The institutional leader in a complex multilevel organisation behaves more as a dungeon master
In a complex multilevel organisation the leader takes care of setting the context in which the team is working.
Having a privileged communication position
They set expectations and the team members ask support to meet the expectations. A dungeon master takes care of their players!
And also takes care that 

## Communication issues
- conflicting messages
- lack of perceived authority
- projecting uncertainty
