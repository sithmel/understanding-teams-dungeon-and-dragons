            Hi, today I am going to talk about teams and teamwork.
            <br />

            ...Introduce yourself...
            <br />
            <br />
            Dungeons and dragons is a role playing game played by a master (who
            leads the game and creates the world) and a group of players who
            form a party of adventurers, ready to be involved in the fantasy
            world generated by the Dungeon Master. We will be talking about this
            because there are many things in common between a D&D party and a
            team. At least from the academic point of view ...

            Speaking of which I met my through a common group of friends playing
            D&D (something like 35 years ago). I think this had a lot of
            influence in our relationship, we are still 2 nerds and we call each
            other "monster" as a sort of pet name. I am mentioning this because
            she later went studying Psychology at University, and this turned up
            particularly helpful for me many years after ...

            Many years ago I had the opportunity to become a manager. Being
            an engineer from most of my career, it was really a big change, and
            I felt really unprepared for the task. Luckily enough my "monster",
            handed me over an old university sociology textbook that explains
            how a group of people "works". I found it incredibly helpful and I
            still refer to that after many years.

            In D&D every player has a specific class: warriors, wizard, paladin,
            thief etc. Adventures are often designed in such a way to make
            teamwork and collaboration across different characters and classes
            necessary to be successful.

            In D&D each player has a sheet with their character's stats: like
            intelligence, strength, dexterity, wisdom etc. Team characteristics
            are like that, but measured on a team. This is another useful model
            that can be used to identify team issues.

            So far we discussed the relation of team members; but teams can have
            a characteristic of their own. A functional team needs the right
            amount of each one of these characteristics. Not too low, and not
            too high. Diversity plays also a big role in balancing the
            characteristics.

            The institutional leader behaves more as a dungeon master. They
            describes "reality" to their team "translate" the confusing messages
            that come from the organisation in a way that is coherent and
            unambiguous. The leader bring order to chaos, and take their team
            together in a journey to achieve the team goals. Said in another
            way: the leader takes care of setting the context in which the team
            is working. They set expectations for the team members and the team
            members ask their support to meet the expectations. A dungeon master
            takes care that the game is enjoyable by their players!

            A D&D party can function at its best not just through individual
            initiative, but also through coordination of their actions. In a
            group of people this is facilitated by a leader. This can emerge
            naturally or instituted by the organisation.<br />
            Functional leadership<br />
            One or more leaders are chosen by the team based on their
            competence. They can change over time, as they are the result of a
            negotiation. They are chosen when the members feel the necessity to
            be led. The istitutional leader is not enough for covering all team
            needs.
